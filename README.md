# 2024-robotics-challenges
These are my solutions to the robotics problems that I have made utilising Python for school, to work with the Lego Mindstorms EV3 utilising a linux known as ["EV3Dev" linux](https://www.ev3dev.org/). 

# Process in which to use the solutions
If you wish to utilise these solutions, then what you need to do is you need to first boot up your lego EV3 in the linux. This can be done via following the instruction found [here](https://assets.education.lego.com/v3/assets/blt293eea581807678a/bltb470b9ea6e38f8d4/5f8802fc4376310c19e33714/getting-started-with-micropython-v2_enus.pdf?locale=en-us) to boot it. 

Then, use a USB connection to connect your device to the EV3 Linux, and then download the files over utilising the [Visual Studio Code Extension for EV3](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lego-education.ev3-micropython). You can run it by having the connection directly to the EV3 machine, or by downloading it. Again, all instructions can be found on the lego website I linked before. It's a good idea to give that a good read, it makes the process 10 times easier for you.

If there are any problems, or really anything, feel free to reach out to me.
